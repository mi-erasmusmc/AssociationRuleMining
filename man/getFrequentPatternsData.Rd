\arguments{
\item{connectionDetails}{An R object of type\cr\code{connectionDetails} created using the
function \code{createConnectionDetails} in the
\code{DatabaseConnector} package.}

\item{cdmDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that contains the OMOP CDM
instance.  Requires read permissions to this database. On SQL
Server, this should specifiy both the database and the schema,
so for example 'cdm_instance.dbo'.
permissions to this database.}

\item{cohortId}{A unique identifier to define the at risk cohort. CohortId is
used to select the cohort_concept_id in the cohort-like table.
date can appear. Date format is 'yyyymmdd'.}

\item{cohortDatabaseSchema}{The name of the database schema that is the location where the
cohort data used to define the at risk cohort is available.
Requires read permissions to this database.}

\item{cohortTable}{The tablename that contains the at risk cohort.  cohortTable has
format of COHORT table: cohort_concept_id, SUBJECT_ID,
COHORT_START_DATE, COHORT_END_DATE.}

\item{sampleSize}{If not NULL, only this number of people will be sampled from the target population (Default NULL)}

\item{covariateSettings}{An object of type \code{covariateSettings} as created using the
\code{createCovariateSettings} function in the
\code{FeatureExtraction} package.}

\item{excludeDrugsFromCovariates}{A redundant option}
}
\value{
Returns an object of type \code{plpData}, containing information on the cohorts, their
outcomes, and baseline covariates. Information about multiple outcomes can be captured at once for
efficiency reasons. This object is a list with the following components: \describe{
\item{cohorts}{A data frame listing the persons in each cohort, listing their
exposure status as well as the time to the end of the observation period and time to the end of the
cohort (usually the end of the exposure era).} \item{covariates}{An ffdf object listing the
baseline covariates per person in the two cohorts. This is done using a sparse representation:
covariates with a value of 0 are omitted to save space.} \item{covariateRef}{An ffdf object describing the covariates that have been extracted.}
\item{metaData}{A list of objects with information on how the cohortMethodData object was
constructed.} } The generic \code{()} and \code{summary()} functions have been implemented for this object.
}
\description{
This function executes a large set of SQL statements against the database in OMOP CDM format to
extract the data needed to perform the analysis.
}
\details{
Based on the arguments, the at risk cohort data is retrieved, as well as outcomes
occurring in these subjects. The at risk cohort is identified  through
user-defined cohorts in a cohort table either inside the CDM instance or in a separate schema.
Similarly, outcomes are identified
through user-defined cohorts in a cohort table either inside the CDM instance or in a separate
schema. Covariates are automatically extracted from the appropriate tables within the CDM.
If you wish to exclude concepts from covariates you will need to
manually add the concept_ids and descendants to the \code{excludedCovariateConceptIds} of the
\code{covariateSettings} argument.
